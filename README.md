Program flow (I guess):

Krypton.rs:
Uses std::env & std:: process crates.
Read command line arguments and parse into config struct.

Config.rs:
Splits command line arguments into "mode" and "scheme" struc values.

Mode.rs:
Mode is an enum with values Encrypt, Decrypt, Analyse
has parse function.
Determines if we want to encrypt, decrypt or break the cipher.
If anything other than these values or if no mode input given, we get error messages "Unknown mode of operation. ü§î" or "No mode of operation provided. üßê"
