# krypton
A Rust implementation of Enigma (and other classical cryptosystems) as well as their cryptanalyses.

Program flow (I guess):

Krypton.rs:
Uses std::env & std:: process crates.
Read command line arguments and parse into config struct.

Config.rs:
Config is a struct composed of Mode and Scheme structs.
Has parse function which takes command line arguments and sends them to "Mode" and "Scheme" struc t parse functions.
Returns result object of Config struct composed of result of mode and Scheme parse functions.

Mode.rs:
Mode is an enum with values Encrypt, Decrypt, Analyse
has parse function takes command line arguments and determines if we want to encrypt, decrypt or break the cipher.
If anything other than these values or if no mode input given, we get error messages "Unknown mode of operation. 🤔" or "No mode of operation provided. 🧐"

Scheme.rs:
Scheme is an enum with values Caesar, Affine, Enigma
has parse function which takes command line arguments and determines if the encryption/decryption/breaking algorithm we are applying is for the Affine, Caeser or Enigma scheme
If anything other than these values or if no mode input given, we get error messages "scheme => Unknown scheme. 🤔" or "scheme => No encryption scheme provided. 🧐"

Caesar.rs:
uses std::error::Error
Takes Mode and command line input arguments
If the mode is analyse/break, then we use the run function of analyse struct
else, we extract the key from the command line arguments into a key struct.
This is a 'shift' value in the case of Caesar.
We call encrypt struct's run function with this key argument, or decrypt struct's run function with this key argument depending on whether the mode is encrypt of decrypt.


Analyse.rs:
Has dictionary.rs---> has contains functions which finds given word in dictionary using binary search ---> Make binary search sound big big biggg
